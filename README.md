# pong
A clone of the good old fashioned pong game written in JS


# Todo

* add proper collision detection for paddles i.e. the ball should only collide within the y-range of the paddle
* fix key delay issue
* refactor collision management i.e.
	* move all collision stuff from common.js to their own file
	* ~~refactor *findCollision* if possible~
